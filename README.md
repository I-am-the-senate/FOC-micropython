FOC BLDCdriver running off micropython
AS5600 encoder and configure other in the code

https://github.com/candyriver/MicroPython-FOC
I was looking for micropython driver for BLDC motors FOC library but this is the only one and its not even finished. 
Thus i started from Simple foc to make a library that actually works
The AS5600 library comes from that.
